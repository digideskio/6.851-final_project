-add string hashing for one of the functions
  -maksim writes hashing for strings in both multiplicative and one of the tabulation hashing
  probably 32bits  - Done!
   -maksim writes linear and quad for those -  done

 - and maksim writes linear and quad for just multiplicative for numbrs
 - yuzhi does chainging for multuplicative
 - yuzhi does chaining eventually for strings (both multiplicative and tabulation hashing

-yuzhi: add max query
-yuzhi: add timing data
