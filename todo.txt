- write code for collision handling
  - linear probing
  - qudratic probing
  - double hash probing
  - chaining
- benchmark by table size, hash size, load factor, different collision handling
- also try different computer architecture like one 32 bit one 64 bit
- dictionary!!!??? i..... ummmm
  - find a list of words
  - add code that handles strings
    - merge two chars into 1
    -doing that recursively and stuff kthxbai
    - do benchmark on dictionary stuff
-write the report using sharelatex.com
-make lots of graphs!!!
